Problem Statement: Given two sorted arrays, arr1, and arr2 of size n and m. Find the union of two sorted arrays.

The union of two arrays can be defined as the common and distinct elements in the two arrays.NOTE: Elements in the union should be in ascending order.

Example 1:
Input:

n = 5,m = 5.
arr1[] = {1,2,3,4,5}  
arr2[] = {2,3,4,4,5}
Output:

 {1,2,3,4,5}

Explanation: 

Common Elements in arr1 and arr2  are:  2,3,4,5
Distnict Elements in arr1 are : 1
Distnict Elemennts in arr2 are : No distinct elements.
Union of arr1 and arr2 is {1,2,3,4,5}
