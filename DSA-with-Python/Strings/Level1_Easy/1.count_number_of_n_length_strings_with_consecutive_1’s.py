'''*******************************************************************************************************
Given a number n, count number of n length strings with consecutive 1â€™s in them.

Input  : n = 2
Output : 1
There are 4 strings of length 2, the
strings are 00, 01, 10 and 11. Only the 
string 11 has consecutive 1's.
